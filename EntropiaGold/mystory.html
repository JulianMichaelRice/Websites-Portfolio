        <p class="text-center hidden">
            EntropiaGold was created by me, Rachel MsPudding Hawkins, in the Fall of 2018, but my story starts long before that.  MsPudding was born in December, 2010 on Calypso.  I began my EU career as a trader in Port Atlantis, later moving to Twin Peaks, purchasing Ores and EnMatters and helping move them on the in-game auction house.  Later, I acquired a knack for vehicle trade and item trade.  Trading however, wasn’t fun, and it quickly became a tiresome bother.  My trading career lasted 2-3 months.  This is where the real fun began to happen.
            <br><br>
            I quickly began to work on my Argonaut Iron Mission, grinding away hour after hour just North of Twin Peaks.  It wasn’t long before I experienced that incredible, and unmistaken feeling of those swirling golden lights, showered by an 8k Argonaut Young.  After the initial shock, I felt accomplishment, and borderline invincibility.
            <br><br>
            From there I began mining, crafting, and exploring the vast universe and planets MindArk and planet partners had to offer.  There were creatures five times my size that I vowed one day I would kill.  There was armor so beautiful and weapons so powerful, that I only dreamed of the day I would one day own them.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-center hidden">More than anything though, deep down, my ultimate goal and passion was to one day become a Land Area Owner. </h4>

            In many ways this game felt like the Wild West, survival of the fittest, and has been one of the most difficult games I continue to learn. I chipped out in 2012, and later returned in 2013. I have stayed active on and off since then with zero plans of ever chipping out again.  I am here to stay, baby.  I love this place. I love the people.
            <br><br>
            I avoid drama, and as a result have refrained from joining any particular society.  I am friends with anyone who wants to be. I admire the many people dedicated to the soc, and dedicated to helping others, and maybe one day I’ll find my place.  I consider the community at large my soc. I can proudly say that in all my time in game, I have only ever had to add 2 people to my ‘mute list’. That speaks volumes to the great character of Entropians.
            <br><br>
            I’ve uninstalled other games in minutes because of the toxic and abusive communities, but not Entropia. Our community is special. There have always been numerous people willing to help me out since day one. There was never any shortage of eager people willing to point me in the right direction or spark up an interesting conversation. 
            <br><br>
            My avatar accomplishments are modest compared to some, but they are wholly mine.  I am proud of what I’ve become. I’ve come from organizing Opalo Hunts in Twin peaks to reaching over 300 natural HP and 460k skills. I’ve placed 1st in 50% of the Mayhem’s I’ve competed in, and seek to compete in more.
            <br><br>
            I wanted to explore every facet of Entropia. I wanted to learn the game for myself. I wanted to create my own success, and share my experience with others. Entropia is a game unlike any other. I have found some of the best people I know in Entropia. The challenge is what drove me, the opportunity is what excites me, and the community is what keeps me here.
